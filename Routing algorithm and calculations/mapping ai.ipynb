      "Chatbot: To get from Hamad International Airport to The Pearl-Qatar, there are a few transportation options available:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Taxi: Taxis are easily available at the airport and are a convenient way to get to The Pearl-Qatar. The distance is about 25 km, and the travel time is around 30 minutes during normal traffic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Private transfer: A private transfer offers a more personalized and comfortable travel experience from the airport to The Pearl-Qatar. You can book a private transfer in advance or upon arrival at the airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Bus: You may also take the public bus as an option. The Karwa Bus (bus number 777) runs from the airport to The Pearl-Qatar, with a travel time of about 50 minutes. The bus leaves every 20 minutes from the bus terminal located near the airport parking area.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Uber/Careem: Ride-hailing services like Uber and Careem are also available at the airport, and you can use them to get to The Pearl-Qatar.\n",
      "okay how much time do i need \n",
      "Chatbot: You should allow at least 30 minutes to one hour for travel time from Hamad International Airport to The Pearl-Qatar, depending on the mode of transportation and traffic conditions. Taxis and private transfers will get you there faster as they are not subjected to regular bus stops and schedules. If you choose to take the public bus, it may take around 50 minutes to reach The Pearl-Qatar, and you will need to factor in the time to walk to the bus terminal to catch the bus.\n",
      "okay thank you\n",
      "Chatbot: You're welcome! Have a great trip to The Pearl-Qatar!\n",

      "3. Bus: The Mowasalat bus service (Karwa) has a few routes that go to the Pearl Qatar. However, the bus system in Doha can be a bit complicated, and the frequency of buses may not be very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Private transfer: You can also arrange for a private transfer from the airport to Pearl Qatar. Several car rental companies and private taxi services offer this service. The price may vary depending on the type of vehicle and the time of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.\n",
      "whats the route name if i go bus\n",
      "Chatbot: You can take bus route number 777 or 737 to reach the Pearl Qatar from Hamad International Airport. The bus stop is located at the arrival terminal, and the bus departs approximately every 20 minutes. However, as I mentioned earlier, the frequency of buses may not be very high and the bus system in Doha can be a bit complicated. I would recommend using other modes of transport like taxis, ride-hailing apps, or private transfers, which are more convenient and reliable.\n",
      "and whats the bus number\n",
      "Chatbot: As I mentioned earlier, you can take either bus number 777 or 737 from Hamad International Airport to reach the Pearl Qatar. These buses are operated by Mowasalat (Karwa), the state-owned public transport company in Qatar. The bus number and route name are typically displayed on the front and sides of the bus, so be sure to look out for these when boarding the bus. However, I would recommend checking the schedule and routes beforehand to avoid any confusion.\n",
      "i want to go to bahren\n",
      "Chatbot: To go to Bahrain from Qatar, you have two options:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Take a flight: You can take a flight from Doha to Bahrain. There are several airlines that offer flights between these two cities, including Qatar Airways, Gulf Air, and Bahrain Air. The flight time is around 1 hour, and the cost varies depending on the airline, time of day, and how far in advance you book your ticket.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Use the causeway: Another option is to drive or take a bus across the King Fahd Causeway, which connects Qatar and Bahrain. You can rent a car or taxi from Doha and drive across the causeway to Bahrain. Alternatively, you can take a bus from the Karwa Bus Station in Doha to Manama, the capital of Bahrain. The duration of the bus ride is approximately 5 hours.\n",

There are several reputable taxi and ride-hailing companies operating in Doha, such as Karwa taxis, Uber, and Careem. You can download their respective apps on your smartphone and book a ride to the airport from The Pearl, Doha.

However, you can take the public bus service from Medina Centrale which is accessible from The Pearl, Doha to Al Ghanim Bus Station. From there, you can take Bus Number 777 operated by Mowasalat to reach the airport. Please note that the journey time would be longer than a taxi or a ride-hailing service, and you would need to factor in the waiting time for the buses. Alternatively, you can consider taking a taxi or a ride-hailing service for a more direct and faster journey to the airport.\n",
